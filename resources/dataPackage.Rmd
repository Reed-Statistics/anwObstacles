```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Step 1** (I did this for you): Create a version control R package.  

+ Create package with `usethis::create_package("~/filepath/math241S20PkgGrpX")` (insert your group number).
+ Add `git` with `usethis::use_git()`.
    + Don't commit.
    + But do restart.
    + Then commit the DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE.
+ Add to GitHub with `usethis::use_github(organisation = "Reed-Statistics", private = TRUE)` (You can't do this step without changing settings so skip for now.)
    
**Step 2**: Create a version control R project called, `math241S20PkgGrpX` (insert your group number), that is linked to the GitHub repo, `math241S20PkgGrpX` (insert your group number).  

* Make sure you have a **Git** pane and a **Build** pane in the upper-right window of your RStudio session.

**Step 3**: List the following files in the `.gitignore`:

- `.gitignore`
- `.Rbuildignore`
- `math241S20PkgGrpX` (insert your group number)

**Step 4**: Add the raw data and transform it into the clean form I want to share in the package.

- Run the function `usethis::use_data_raw()` to create a `data-raw` folder in the R project and the file `DATASET.R`.
- Put the raw data files in the `data-raw` folder.
- Use the file `DATASET.R` to load and wrangle the raw data.
- At the bottom of the wrangling file, include the following code to create a clean `.Rda` file:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Swap pdxTrees for the name of your data
usethis::use_data(pdxTrees, overwrite = TRUE)
```

- Run the code in `DATASET.R` to create a new folder called `data` that contains the cleaned data file.



**Step 5**: Create the documentation/help file for the data.

-  Run `usethis::use_r("insert_data_name")` to create a script file.
- Add [`roxygen`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) comments that document the dataset. 
    + Here's an [example](https://github.com/mcconvil/pdxTrees/blob/master/R/pdxTrees.R).
    + See the [Object Documentation Chapter](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) of [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/).
- Run `devtools::document()`, which creates the `man` folder and an `Rd` help file.
- Run `?insert_data_name` in the console to view the help file.  

```{r, out.width="100%", echo=FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("roxygen_help_file.png")
```
- Notice that you need to include the dataset name as a string in the bottom of the R script.  If you forget this, the help file for that dataset won't be created!


**Step 6**: Edit the [DESCRIPTION file](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/description.html) and consider creating a Readme file.  The code `usethis::use_readme_md(open = interactive())` generates a skeleton Readme file.  

**Step 7**: Delete any extraneous files or list them in .Rbuildignore.

**Step 8**: Run checks with `devtools::check(document = FALSE)` to make sure the package compiles without errors or warnings.  Run `devtools::load_all()` to simulates the process of building, installing, and attaching the package if you want to check its contain.

- Fix any errors or warnings.  (Note: it will still compile under warnings.)

**Step 9**: Try installing the package with `devtools::install()`.

**Step 10/Always**: Push the changes to the GitHub repository.
