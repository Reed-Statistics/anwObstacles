## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(math241S20PkgGrp9)
dataANW <- anwObstacles
loc = plyr::count(dataANW$`Location`)
colnames(loc) <- c("Location","Total_Freq")
sort(loc$freq, decreasing = TRUE)
final = ddply(dataANW, .(dataANW$Location, dataANW$`Round/Stage`), nrow)
colnames(final) <- c("Location","Round/Stage","Freq")
final <- left_join(final, loc)
final[is.na(final)] <- 0
final$frequency = loc$freq
View(loc)

g <- ggplot(final, aes(x = reorder(Location,-Total_Freq),y = Freq, fill = `Round/Stage`))
g + geom_col(position="stack")+ theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + labs(x = "Location", y = "Frequency of Occurence")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
